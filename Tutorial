🧬 Ortholog Identification and Positive Selection Analysis in Single-Copy Genes.

This repository documents the bioinformatics workflow developed to identify orthologous genes and estimate nonsynonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitution rates based on 1,020 single-copy genes (SCGs) derived from transcriptomes of 18 samples representing three species of the genus Mepraia (6 samples per species).

The primary goal of this analysis is to detect genes potentially evolving under positive selection between lineages, combining orthology inference, codon-based alignment, substitution rate estimation, and functional annotation.

🧪 Samples analyzed
Mepraia spinolai (6 samples)

Mepraia gajardoi (6 samples)

Mepraia parapatrica (6 samples)

Transcriptomes were assembled using Trinity and annotated with TransDecoder, followed by selection of single-copy orthologous genes.

🧭 Workflow summary

Standardized renaming of transcript headers
Custom scripts were used to rename FASTA headers in the format SampleID@N (e.g., ms1@1, mp15@7) to ensure consistent traceability across the dataset.

Open Reading Frame (ORF) prediction with GetORF (EMBOSS)
ORFs with a minimum length of 150 amino acids were retained.

Translation of ORFs to peptides using Transeq (EMBOSS)

Ortholog inference using OrthoFinder + DIAMOND
Translated protein sets from all 18 samples were analyzed with OrthoFinder, employing multiple sequence alignment (MAFFT) and orthogroup inference via MCL clustering.

Filtering for pairwise single-copy orthologs
Only one-to-one orthologous genes between species pairs were retained for downstream analysis.

Codon-aware alignments with ParaAT v1.0
Codon alignments were generated from protein alignments and corresponding CDS using ParaAT.

Ka, Ks, and Ka/Ks estimation using KaKs_Calculator v2.0
Substitution rates were calculated using the YN (Yang & Nielsen) model. Orthologs were excluded if:

Alignment length was < 150 bp

Ks > 0.1 (to avoid possible paralogs)

Ka or Ks values were unavailable

Detection of positive selection
Orthologs with Ka/Ks > 1 were considered as candidates under positive selection.

Functional annotation and GO enrichment (optional)
Candidate genes can be annotated using public databases, and GO enrichment analyses can be performed using ClusterProfiler (R/Bioconductor).

📦 Conda environment
A Conda environment is provided to ensure reproducibility. The pipeline depends on the following tools:

EMBOSS (getorf, transeq)
OrthoFinder
DIAMOND
MAFFT
ParaAT (via GitHub)
KaKs_Calculator (via SourceForge)
